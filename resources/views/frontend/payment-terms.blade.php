            1.10. Chargebacks and Reversals.
        </b>
        Psychic acknowledges and agrees that any Payment by a User is subject to a right of chargeback if paid by credit or debit card or reversal if an ACH transaction, as these rights exist between the User and his/her respective bank or credit card issuer. In the event of a chargeback or reversal of any Payment by a User, Psychics1on1 will automatically deduct such amount plus any fees associated with the chargeback or reversal from your bank account. Thereafter, Psychics1on1 will open a resolution case and investigate the reason for the charge back. You agree to cooperate with Psychics1on1 and to provide any information that may be reasonably requested by Psychics1on1 in its investigation. In the event it is determined that the Psychic was not at fault in connection with the chargeback, Psychics1on1 will use commercially reasonable efforts to dispute the chargeback on your behalf. In the event it is determined that the chargeback was due to Psychic negligence or other similar circumstances, Psychics1on1 will, in its sole discretion, charge the Chargeback Fee to the Psychic. You are liable for all chargeback or reversals of Payments processed on your behalf by Psychics1on1, including the Chargeback Fee listed in the Fees Schedule.
